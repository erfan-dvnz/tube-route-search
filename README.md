# Search Implementations
 Implementing Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, and Uniform Cost Search to find optimal routes between two underground stations.
 
  bfs-dfs-ucs.py contains the code for said search methods.
  improving_cost_function.py attempts to extend the cost function by considering the number of line changes as well rather than time only.
  heuristic.py attempts to decrease the number of nodes explored.
